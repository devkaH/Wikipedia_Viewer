# Wikipedia viewer
In this mini-project I have developed a  web application that shows search result using wikipidea API, as part of my full stack JavaScript training offered by [GOMYCODE Tunisia](https://www.gomycode.tn)
## Project brief
This is a small web application wich does the following:

<strong>User Story</strong>  I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

<strong>User Story</strong>  I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

<strong>User Story</strong>  I can click a button to clear search results.



The following screenshot shows my App:

* Use wikipedea API.

* Use jquery to manipulate the response of ajax call.

* Integrate  bootstrap template in our project .
